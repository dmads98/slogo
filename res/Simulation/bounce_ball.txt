things that need implementation for the simulation

front end

1. add a go button(like cell society - that can control speed) don't really need a slider
this will make the simulation run using step function - or just repeat playing go button

-> clicking this button will run 'go' command
->

2.

back end
2-1. if not, make a button so that the button executes go method everytime it is clicked
