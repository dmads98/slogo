things that need implementation for the simulation

front end

1. add a play button(like cell society - that can control speed) don't really need a slider
this will make the simulation run using step function
2.

back end
1. make an example bounce ball file
2. make a command(or something) similar to "tick"
2-1. if not, make a button so that this is a simulation
3. make reset-ticks command
4. make abs(absolute value) command
5. make leave-trace command
6. make tick command
