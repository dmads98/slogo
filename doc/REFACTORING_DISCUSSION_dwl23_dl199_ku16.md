# Front End

Upon comments from Professor Duvall, the biggest change for the frontend was changing the public instance variables
to private instance variables and adding getters as the method of communication instead. This was done in the refactoring.
The second biggest change was magic values, which were apparent throughout FrontendController. This was also dealt with.
